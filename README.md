## Goal

To create visualizations based on a supermarket dataset to suggest how the store can maximize profits and reduce losses.
Dataset 

The dataset I used is available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bravehart101/sample-supermarket-dataset">Kaggle</a>. It has information about the storeâ€™s profits, sales, locations, and products. 

## Questions

<ul>
    <li>What are the trends in profit, loss, and sales of the superstore?</li>
    <li>How do they differ among different states and cities?</li>
    <li>Do discounts help the store make more profit or only make customers happy?</li>
</ul>

## Overview

The variables of interest are profit, sales, discount, quantity, and location. Here is a quick summary:
